This repository contains notebook code and data for the paper: *Explainable AI for Trees: From Local Explanations to Global Understanding*

This paper presents the first exact game theoretic solution for explaining predictions from tree ensemble models, the most widely used non-linear machine learning models; this solution is the only one that guarantees desirable properties and so enables new insights into individual predictions and global behavior of the model.

**Ways to explore the results and code behind the paper:**
- Use TreeExplainer to explain your own tree-based models with the popular Python [shap package](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).

- Check out the [local explanation benchmark](https://suinleelab.github.io/treeexplainer-study/benchmark/cric/index.html) results.

- Download the [NHANES I data](https://github.com/suinleelab/treeexplainer-study/tree/master/notebooks/mortality) (the chronic kidney disease and hospital datasets require approval for access)

- Browse the [released notebooks](https://github.com/suinleelab/treeexplainer-study/tree/master/notebooks) (still under construction).
