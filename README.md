This repository contains notebook code and data for the paper: *Explainable AI for Trees: From Local Explanations to Global Understanding*

This paper presents the first exact game theoretic solution for explaining predictions from tree ensemble models, the most widely used non-linear machine learning models; this solution is the only one that guarantees desirable properties and so enables new insights into individual predictions and global behavior of the model.

**Ways to explore the results and code behind the paper:**
- Explain your own tree-based models with the popular Python [shap package](https://pypi.org/project/shap).

- Check out the [local explanation benchmark](http://asdfasdf) results.

- Download the [NHANES I data](http://asdfasdf) (the chronic kidney disease and hospital datasets require approval for access)
