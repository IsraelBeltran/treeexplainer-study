This repository contains notebook code and data for the paper: *Explainable AI for Trees: From Local Explanations to Global Understanding*

This paper presents the first exact game theoretic solution for explaining predictions from tree ensemble models, the most widely used non-linear machine learning models; this solution is the only one that guarantees desirable properties and so enables new insights into individual predictions and global behavior of the model.

**Ways to explore the results and code behind the paper:**
- Use TreeExplainer to explain your own tree-based models with the popular Python [shap package](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).
    *  System requirements: Any recent Mac, Windows, or Linux OS. See https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/shap/files for a list of systems with precompiled binaries the codes is unit tested on.
    * Installation: See https://github.com/slundberg/shap (install time is typically < 1 min)
    * Demo: See the TreeExplainer demos at https://github.com/slundberg/shap, the demo on the front page runs in a few seconds on any modern computer.

- Check out the [local explanation benchmark](https://suinleelab.github.io/treeexplainer-study/benchmark/cric/index.html) results.

- Download the [NHANES I data](https://github.com/suinleelab/treeexplainer-study/tree/master/notebooks/mortality) (the chronic kidney disease and hospital datasets require approval for access)

- Browse the [released notebooks](https://github.com/suinleelab/treeexplainer-study/tree/master/notebooks) (still under construction).
